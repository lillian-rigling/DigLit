## I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watching Me
### Practical Lessons in Digital Privacy

This activity uses [Apply Magic Sauce](https://applymagicsauce.com), a web-based tool created at the University of Cambridge. It predicts psychological traits from the digital footprint of social media users. Players have the opportunity to explore their data profile. The purpose of this activity is to raise awareness of the information collected about us and to promote the responsible creation of online information.

Invite passersby to participate by asking, “Do you want to find out who Facebook thinks you are?” While players are looking at their data profile, talk to them about how they can tighten up their privacy settings in Facebook and other social media platforms. Tell them about other tools they might want to explore, such as [Predictive World](https://predictiveworld.watchdogs.com/en/) or this [Online Privacy Libguide](http://guides.lib.uwo.ca/online_privacy).
