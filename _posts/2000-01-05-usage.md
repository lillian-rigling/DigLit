## Fake News and You
### Critically Evaluating Information 

This card sorting game was created using [Media Bias Fact Check](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com), an online media bias resource founded in 2015 by Dave Van Zandt, to show the bias of popular news sources and raise awareness of the tools that are available to help readers in evaluating news content. MediaBias/FactCheck uses a strict and transparent methodology to determine the media bias of various news sources.

Invite passersby to participate by asking, “How well do you know the media bias of your favourite news sources?” Players align the logos of different media outlets on a grid with four quadrants based on their perception of that media outlet’s reporting bias and level of factual reporting. Use the cheat sheet to reveal the bias as determined by MediaBias/FactCheck.

Offer players the IFLA pamphlet with useful links printed on the back that they can use to help evaluate online information.
