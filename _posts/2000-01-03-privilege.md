## Checking Your Information Privilege

### Recognizing Inequitable Access and Injustice in Media

This activity is a tactile card game where the participant arranges the cards in order from lowest priced item to highest priced item. The cards are flipped over to see how accurate their assumption was. The game raises awareness of the cost of resources and the information privilege afforded to those enrolled in post-secondary education.

Invite passersby to participate by asking, “How much would you guess the library pays for your access to scholarly resources?” Players get three cards to arrange: two item cards and one library-funded resource card. Facilitators of the activity should be prepared to speak to each of the resources listed, explaining what the resource is for users who may not recognize the pictures or logos. Once they’ve arranged them in order from what the expect is the least costly to the most costly, flip the cards over to reveal the actual price of each. What follows is an opportunity to talk to the participant about the value of the resources on the cards (especially those provided by the library) and promote open access. 

*Optional: Ask students to complete the following sentence on a whiteboard: “If I lost access to library resources today, I would…”. This allows for reflection on one’s own information privilege. Take photographs of the whiteboards for future reference (and include participants in the photographs with permission).*
